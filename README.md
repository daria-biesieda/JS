# Dino Game ðŸ¦–ðŸŒµ

Hi! I'm Daria, and this is a small project I made for practice.  
It's a simple runner game inspired by the Google offline Dino game: the dinosaur runs and jumps over cactuses.

## What I did
I built this game using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The main features I implemented:
- Animated the dinosaur and obstacles with CSS and JS  
- Made the dinosaur jump when pressing **Space** 
- Created a simple collision detection system to detect when the dinosaur hits a cactus   

## What I learned
Working on this game helped me:
- Practice **DOM manipulation** and event handling in JavaScript  
- Understand **game logic** like collisions and scoring  
- Work with **CSS animations**  
- Improve my problem-solving and debugging skills  

## How to play
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dino-game.git
